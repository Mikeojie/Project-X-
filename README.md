# Frontend Mentor - Stats preview card component

![Design preview for the Stats preview card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! 👋

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

#My objective

Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

The designs are in JPG static format.

If you would like the design files (we provide Sketch & Figma versions) to inspect the design in more detail, you can [subscribe as a PRO member](https://www.frontendmentor.io/pro).

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

##Steps in building the project

1. I initialized the project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Creating a repo will make it easier to share your code with the community
2. I configured the repository to publish the code to a web address. 
3. Looking through the designs to start planning out how to tackle the project.
4. Before adding any styles, I structured the content with HTML.
5. I wrote out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. I started adding styles to the top of the page and work down. 

## Deploying the project

As mentioned above, there are many ways to host your project for free. Recommend hosts are:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

I did use Github pages and Netlify to host this project
